I am currently studying BSc at Premier University through CSE. I really enjoy working as well as learning languages and frameworks like JS, React JS. Also, I have ideas about Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI about my Design. Node JS, Express, and MongoDB also have ideas about the backend. I have experience of 10+ web <Link to='/projects' className="text-decoration-none cool-link fw-bold">projects</Link> by using JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB and other technologies. I have also solid knowledge of CSS framework like bootstrap, tailwind, material-ui. Outside of programming, I enjoy reading books, arts and gardening.
